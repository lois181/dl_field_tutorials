Tutorial for box of rigid water
===============================

.. note::
    The following tutorial assumes you have compiled DL_field and are working from the **dl_f_4.6** directory. Please visit
    the :doc:`getting started <getting_started>` page before starting.

In this tutorial, we will use DL_FIELD to create a box of SPC/E water.

We require that DL_FIELD has been compiled within a Linux environment (including WSL and cygwin), and you have 
installed both DL_POLY and GROMACS on your system. There are instructions on compiling both software on their 
respective websites.

.. _create_box:

Creating a water box
--------------------

DL_FIELD has a dedicated solution maker which can be used to create boxes of liquid. This is specified in the 
*control* file with the below line (line 13)

.. code-block:: text

    1 1.05 g/cm^3 1.6  * Solution Maker: on/off, density, unit, cutoff

which takes the following options:

.. glossary::

   **On/Off Flag**
      ``1`` to turn the solution maker on; ``0`` to turn it off.

   **Density**
      The target density of your box (e.g. ``0.1`` for 0.1 mol/dm続).

   **Unit**
      The density units (e.g. ``g/cm続``). This determines the number of molecules in the system 
      depending on simulation box size. The box must be orthogonal. Density units, ``kg/cm続``, and concentration 
      units, ``mol/dm続``, are also available. Specifying ``molecule`` allows the user to specify the number 
      of molecules.

   **Cutoff**
      The minimum separation (in angstroms) used when packing the liquid molecules (e.g. ``1.6``).


This feature randomly orientates the liquid molecule template and inserts duplicates of them into the 
simulation box. Sometimes, DL_FIELD might be unsuccessful, in which case users should adjust the cutoff value. 

Using the key options highlighted in the following *control* file, we can make a box of SPC/E water with 
the Solution Maker. The initial input *spce.pdb* can be accessed `here <_static/spce.pdb>`__.

Visualisation
-------------

After running DL_FIELD:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./dl_field


we can view the output structure file (.gro) in VMD or similar software:

.. image:: _static/water.png
    :alt: VMD image of a 4 nm x 4 nm x 4 nm box of SPC/E water 
    :align: center
    :width: 500px


We can see here that the water molecules are relatively evenly dispersed within the box. You should always 
check this is the case using the Solution Maker. 

.. note::
    The DL_FIELD Solvation Feature can also be used to create a box of water, making use of the 
    DL_FIELD solvent templates. This is left as an exercise for the reader. See the 
    :doc:`polyethylene-xylene <polyethylene-xylene>` tutorial for an example on how to use this feature.
