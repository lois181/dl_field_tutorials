Tutorial for an OPLS/2005 polyisoprene chain
============================================

.. note::
    The following tutorial assumes you have compiled DL_field and are working from the **dl_f_4.6** directory. Please visit
    the :doc:`getting started <getting_started>` page before starting.

This tutorial provides a walk-through for users to assign parameters to an all-atom 32mer cis-(1,4)-polyisoprene chain using the
OPLS/2005 forcefield. To begin, download the following `polyisoprene.xyz <_static/polyisoprene.xyz>`__ file, which contains the 
polymer structure, to the directory **dl_f_4.6/tutorial_confs/**. 

We will now create an appropriate *control* file and use it to generate DL_POLY and GROMACS input files for our system. Finally, 
we will use DL_field to perform single point calculations across both MD software and compare their outputs. 

The *control* file for this system is printed below

This instructs DL_field to produce GROMACS and DL_POLY input files as outputs. For additional 
guidance and notes on creating a suitable *control* file, please visit the 
`polyisoprene tutorial <polyisoprene_melt>`__. 

Successfully running the program (from the **dl_f_4.6/** home directory) with the command
